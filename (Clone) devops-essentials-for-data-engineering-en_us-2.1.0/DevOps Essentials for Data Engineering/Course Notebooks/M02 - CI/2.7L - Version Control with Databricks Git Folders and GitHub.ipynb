    "Git is an open source framework, but we will be utilizing a Git provider called [GitHub](https://github.com/). This is where your codebase will be hosted for development that:\n",
    "- Hosts Git repos \n",
    "- Provides mechanism for access control \n",

    "- Provides tools and features for CI/CD Pipeline testing ([GitHub Actions](https://docs.databricks.com/en/dev-tools/bundles/ci-cd-bundles.html))\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning Objectives\n",
    "By the end of this course, you will be able to: \n",
    "- Connect your GitHub account to Databricks Git folders using a Personal Access Token (PAT).\n",
    "- Perform basic Git operations like push, commit, pull in Databricks and Merge within GitHub.\n",
